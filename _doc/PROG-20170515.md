Progress on ncdns-nsis
======================

2017-05-15

Development nears completion on the NSIS-based Namecoin and ncdns bundle
installer for Windows.

The [ncdns-nsis](https://github.com/hlandau/ncdns-nsis) repository provides
source code for an NSIS-based installer which can automatically install and
configure Namecoin Core, ncdns and Unbound and configure name resolution of
`.bit` domains via Unbound.

The installer can install Namecoin Core and Unbound automatically, but also
allows users to opt out of the installation of these components if they wish to
provide their own.

Completion of the ncdns-nsis installer project will enable the Namecoin project
to distribute a Windows binary installer providing a turnkey,
configuration-free solution for `.bit` domain resolution. The installer is also
intended to support reproducible builds and can be built from a POSIX system.

At this point, extensive testing is the primary work remaining on the completion
of the ncdns-nsis installer.
